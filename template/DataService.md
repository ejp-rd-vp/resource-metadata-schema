# Data Service
Data services are resources that provide access to data or analytical tools via some
interface. The interface may be machine-readable (I.e., an Application Programming
Interface – API) or via a Web page for humans to interact manually. There are different
conventions for data services on the VP Portal, depending on the “nature” of the service.
Resources that serve via a Web page, must have a landingPage property, while those
that serve via an API must have both an endpointURL and endpointDescription. On the
EJP VP, a service that serves a DCAT Dataset must be connected to a DCAT Distribution
of that Dataset via the dcat:accessService property. A service not serving a dataset (e.g.,
a statistical analysis service, or an ontology lookup service) must be connected to the
top-level DCAT Catalog via the dcat:service property.

## Type 
In the context of a Data Service, if the service
is a Beacon, the range is either dcterms:type
[https://w3id.org/ejp-rd/vocabulary#VPBeacon2_individuals](https://w3id.org/ejp-rd/vocabulary#VPBeacon2_individuals) or
[https://w3id.org/ejp-rd/vocabulary#VPBeacon2_catalog](https://w3id.org/ejp-rd/vocabulary#VPBeacon2_catalog).
If the service is anything besides a Beacon, use
